Neural Data Science is a course on fundamental quantitative methods for systems neuroscience, with a focus on practical applications and good programming practices. 

## Hands-on
In this course, you'll learn to unlock insights from neuroscientific data to write solid, maintainable and reusable software. The course is build around modules which contain code and provides real-world examples and use cases. You will get a practical understanding of the most important and widely used analysis methods in the field of system neuroscience.

## Comprehensive
Get a good overview of the tools that systems neuroscience researchers use in their everyday routine and of the theory that lies under.

## Modular 
Focus on the topics you are most interested in. The course is organized in independent modules which contain an overview of the theory, code examples and exercises, making it easy to focus on what you want and learn it at your own pace.

## Trusted content
This course has been created by a team of expert neuroscientists, coordinated by [Davide Spalla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-spalla-02838aa7/?originalSubdomain=nl). It covers the science, the math and the code behind systems neuroscience core tools. 

## Open
Neural Data Science is open-source and easy to use and extend. The content of this course will be always free for learners and teachers.
